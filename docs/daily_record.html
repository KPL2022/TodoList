        - something new/scary i did today:
        
        - things i tried/did not try and how i feel about them:
    
      - 0109 - Monday
        - carried thru commitment to clean up the yard today
          - self responsibility to follow thru commitment
            - builds foundation for self trust
              - implied expectation that effort investment is put to good use

        - strategy composition feels smoother coming together now
          - logic expression still a bit verbose
          - but better job working with given contexts
            - smoother implementation process
              - emerging use of definitions
        
        - more active exercise today
          - circulation seems to be improving
        
        - better job working on myself
          - salvation is equal parts harsh on the savior as it is on the saved
            - dont mask vice for virtue
