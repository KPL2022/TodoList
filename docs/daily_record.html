        - strategy composition feels smoother coming together now
          - logic expression still a bit verbose
          - but better job working with given contexts
            - smoother implementation process
              - emerging use of definitions

            - exploring relationships between given options as way to further contextualize a strategy
        
          - currently working on exhaustive enumeration/backtracking class of strategies

          - environment maintenance
            - chores

      - 0112 - Thursday

        - shouldve done more reading for food for thoughts
      
        - tried to push day end activities earlier
          - backfired kind of
            - well, didnt expect some things
              - tomorrow should be better
            
      - 0113 - Friday
        - not much progression for LC

        - motivation in part comes from the existence of an "next item" in schedule
        
        - pushed back against delaying items because of desire to "do it well or better or perhaps in secret, perfectly"
          - launched blog with 1st article
            - super basic @ https://kpl2022.github.io/TodoList/blog/on_entry_point_consideration
            
        - performed experiment for 2nd day to try to finish loa related tasks earlier so i can close the day in more timely manner
          - today was a success, as time of writing it is 11:22PM
        
        - something changed
          - before rising above almost compulsive gaming was temporary
            - this time, I feel like i have gained more lasting freedom
              - how? i'm honestly not quite sure
              - im able to convert time i used to spend in games
                - instead of doing nothing of importance with them
                  - im able to funnel those time into productive, meaningful endeavors
                    - to a degree
            
            - im also happier when i do play games
              - i stopped doing things i did not truly enjoy
        
        - relationship management is complex and deeply meaningful concept to master
          - and it is in part because i have not fully mastered my story yet
            - sometimes im not entirely sure why i behave in one way or another
              - what motivate me to say or think the things i do?
                - what motivate others in the same sense?
              - recognizing, reading, processing, and reacting to things that are "in between the lines"
                - a crucial skill i ought to develop further
