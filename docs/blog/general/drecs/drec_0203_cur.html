      <h2>Daily Records 0203 - current</h2>
    
      0203 - Friday
        - progged thru matrix DFS with composite invariant problem 

        - organic schedule
          - balance responsibility and reward
          - and genuinely interested things
            - does not mean no barrier to start
              - 5 min warm up tasks still useful
              - so are 22 min wrapped sessions
              - but genuine intention behind task choice is also important
          
          - examine current schedule 
          - seek to understand habits better 
            - how habits can serve me as a tool or otherwise 
              - a tool to outsource decision making
                - less decision making, more energy efficient
                  - more productivity

            - good habits guide towards proper behavior
              - these kinds of investments are always worth

            - breaking free from bad habits
              - making sacrifices to materially improve myself in a manner that lasts
                - more progress means potentially incrementally more intimate sacrifices
                  - its a choice 
                    - can choose to not sacrifice and stay the same
                    - or sacrifice and change
                    - but 
                      - cant have them both
