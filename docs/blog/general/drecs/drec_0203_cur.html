      <h2>Daily Records 0203 - current</h2>
    
      0203 - Friday
        - progged thru matrix DFS with composite invariant problem 

        - organic schedule
          - balance responsibility and reward
          - and genuinely interested things
            - does not mean no barrier to start
              - 5 min warm up tasks still useful
              - so are 22 min wrapped sessions
              - but genuine intention behind task choice is also important
          
          - examine current schedule 
          - seek to understand habits better 
            - how habits can serve me as a tool or otherwise 
              - a tool to outsource decision making
                - less decision making, more energy efficient
                  - more productivity

            - good habits guide towards proper behavior
              - these kinds of investments are always worth

            - breaking free from bad habits
              - making sacrifices to materially improve myself in a manner that lasts
                - more progress means potentially incrementally more intimate sacrifices
                  - its a choice 
                    - can choose to not sacrifice and stay the same
                    - or sacrifice and change
                    - but 
                      - cant have them both

      0204 - Saturday
        - progged thru graph search type problem 

        - exploring more intimate self connection 
          - esp with the emotional self
            - learning to be aware of and process emotions
        
        - exploring creation of an "organic" schedule
          - learning energy management
          - exploring habit building
            - guide me towards proper behavior
          - observing current schedule
            - under min stress load, what i naturally discovered and am inclined to do on a typical day
      
      0205 - Sunday
        - progged thru contextualized content filtering technique
          - graph search
            - floodfill 
        
        - exploring the viability of a second cycle in the day 

        - starting the day with lc warm up is a decent decision 

        - been writing [T04] article most of the day
          - but the building block technique, i dont quite understand it well enough 
            - to generalize its usage beyond the basic, well-defined scenario
      
      0206 - Monday
        - progged thru dp type problem 
          - prototypical extension

        - shifting focus from managing time to managing energy 
          - context switch is expensive
            - esp costly towards day end 
              - bigger "blocks of tasks" at day end 
                - in general do less at day end

      0207 - Tuesday
        - progged thru more dp problem

        - drafted article on graph search specific content filtering technique
          - floodfill 
      
        - insight 
          - non-compliance is not a primary issue
            - but rather a symptom of an inorganic schedule
          
          - organic is not the only metric to a decent quality schedule
            - "reasonableness" is another one 
              - that has more to do with effective resting
                - and managing my energy properly thruout the day
        
        - willful blindness
          - where am i in my story?
            - bring the fear out to discuss and process 
              - living in delusion is digging ones own grave
              - sooner or later, life catches up to us and we find ourselves in situations where
                - we have no choice but to face our fears
                  - but we dont have to wait until life to teach us those lessons
                    - i think i can materially strengthen myself 
                      - if i can confront and overcome my shortcoming/fears
      
      0208 - Wednesday
        - progged thru dp example of using inference to enhance parts of a strategy
          - and a greedy class example weirdly tagged as dp
        
        - offloaded parts of loa stuff to thursday
          - but these two raiding days still taxing
            - esp at night, need to clarify metrics i use to measure pug grps so i can negotiate and make compromises with myself

        - dp topic cluster
          - i need more experience
            - i dont have what i feel to be a sufficient foundation to really draft
              basis articles for the dp topic yet

          - try to orient tomorrow more on progging problems and topic exploration?
    
        - took long term pill today 
          - maybe i just didnt sleep well or something
            - was difficult to recover energy for later parts of the day
              - was just tired in general 

        - good work noticing myself drifting off though
    
      0209 - Thursday 
        - progged thru classic goal decomp example for dp class problems 

        - 1st thing we do in the morning is important b/c it sets the tone for the rest of the day 

        - i feel like i can manage my energy more easily now
          - easier time noticing shifts in how i feel 
            - and what recovery ritual to do for common feelings of exhaustion 
        
        - tomorrow morning start with drafting basic dp case study article 
      
        - a little update on my story
          - trying to get lvl2 completion badge for Al right now
          - after this week, should have decent base understanding of dp 
          - once i get all lvl2 badges and cover other basic topics like i do with dp
            - and ofc the core problem solving process 
            - i should be ready to look for interview opportunities
        
        - doc check up meeting in a few days
          - will i be able to firmly and truthfully express myself?
            - i didnt have clear goals until recently 
              - so i shouldnt pretend like i did
                - this is the least i can do(not do) for the starter

        - [discuss random thoughts, insights explored today] 
          - learned some interesting stuff about myself from recording and responding to my own emotions
            - im 'aiming up' type person, courage, trusting good faith of my intentions, strength of my approach
              to actualize my intentions
              - some stuff about not assuming too much knowledge of the process of living
                - not holding myself to grow in certain way by certain time
                - but rather like i mentioned above, trust my own intention and the strength of the path i chose

        - [discuss highlights of tomorrow plans] 
          - finish exploring Al2 D14 1, then move to 2 and D15 1 & 2

            - stuff about learning
            - other things i recorded in the journal

          - energy management is improving
            - but my raw energy reserve seems limited 
              - unable to stay afloat with ease after the 12th hour of the day 
        
        - [give update on my story, if any to give]
