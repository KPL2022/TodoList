      <h2>Daily Records 0203 - current</h2>
    
      0203 - Friday
        - progged thru matrix DFS with composite invariant problem 

        - organic schedule
          - balance responsibility and reward
          - and genuinely interested things
            - does not mean no barrier to start
              - 5 min warm up tasks still useful
              - so are 22 min wrapped sessions
              - but genuine intention behind task choice is also important
          
          - examine current schedule 
          - seek to understand habits better 
            - how habits can serve me as a tool or otherwise 
              - a tool to outsource decision making
                - less decision making, more energy efficient
                  - more productivity

            - good habits guide towards proper behavior
              - these kinds of investments are always worth

            - breaking free from bad habits
              - making sacrifices to materially improve myself in a manner that lasts
                - more progress means potentially incrementally more intimate sacrifices
                  - its a choice 
                    - can choose to not sacrifice and stay the same
                    - or sacrifice and change
                    - but 
                      - cant have them both

      0204 - Saturday
        - progged thru graph search type problem 

        - exploring more intimate self connection 
          - esp with the emotional self
            - learning to be aware of and process emotions
        
        - exploring creation of an "organic" schedule
          - learning energy management
          - exploring habit building
            - guide me towards proper behavior
          - observing current schedule
            - under min stress load, what i naturally discovered and am inclined to do on a typical day
      
      0205 - Sunday
        - progged thru contextualized content filtering technique
          - graph search
            - floodfill 
        
        - exploring the viability of a second cycle in the day 

        - starting the day with lc warm up is a decent decision 

        - been writing [T04] article most of the day
          - but the building block technique, i dont quite understand it well enough 
            - to generalize its usage beyond the basic, well-defined scenario
      
      0206 - Monday
        - progged thru dp type problem 
          - prototypical extension

        - shifting focus from managing time to managing energy 
          - context switch is expensive
            - esp costly towards day end 
              - bigger "blocks of tasks" at day end 
                - in general do less at day end

      0207 - Tuesday
        - progged thru more dp problem

        - drafted article on graph search specific content filtering technique
          - floodfill 
      
        - insight 
          - non-compliance is not a primary issue
            - but rather a symptom of an inorganic schedule
          
          - organic is not the only metric to a decent quality schedule
            - "reasonableness" is another one 
              - that has more to do with effective resting
                - and managing my energy properly thruout the day
        
        - willful blindness
          - where am i in my story?
            - bring the fear out to discuss and process 
              - living in delusion is digging ones own grave
              - sooner or later, life catches up to us and we find ourselves in situations where
                - we have no choice but to face our fears
                  - but we dont have to wait until life to teach us those lessons
                    - i think i can materially strengthen myself 
                      - if i can confront and overcome my shortcoming/fears
