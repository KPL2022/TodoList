      - template

        - things i tried/did not try and how i feel about them:
    
      - 0120 - Friday 
        - progged thru IESF framework application
        
        - Bruce meeting
          - need to think more on what my highest values are
          - clearer idea of what constitutes "being ready"
          - bringing market research into scope

        - perhaps sometimes a little patience can go a long way
          - but important to understand better my intentions
            - so i can believe in the authenticity of my own efforts and intentions
            - "good faith" in efforts
          
          - "aim for the heavens, eyes on the tasks at hand"
            - what did JBP mean by this exactly?
